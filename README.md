# BudgetApp


* This app shows the balance, the income and the expense. It includes a dashboard where we can add a new entry (an income or an expense).

* This app has a chart, so the user can easily compare the income and outcome.

* The user's income and expense entry list is stored in the local storage, so when we refresh the page or reboot machine we can always find data there.
